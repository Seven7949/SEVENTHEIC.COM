    <h1>☁️ In the Quiet Shadows: Let’s Talk About AI & Cybersecurity Like Old Friends</h1>

    <p>You ever notice how the rain in the hills doesn’t ask permission? It just arrives—soft, unexpected, almost like a secret. That’s how this morning began in Mussoorie. Fog hugging the trees, everything wrapped in silence, and my old desktop humming to life like it still had something to prove.</p>

    <p>The screen blinked awake. And there it was—not weather forecasts or breaking news, but something far less visible and far more real: alerts, breaches, whispers of cyber trouble halfway across the world. Not thunder. Hackers.</p>

    <p>It made me pause.<br>
    Not so long ago, the threats we worried about were simpler—rustling in the bushes, a monkey trying to steal your toast. Now? It's keystrokes. It's voices that aren’t real. Emails that look <em>too</em> real. Somewhere out there, an AI is learning to fool even the wisest aunties with "chocolate shop discounts" and fake smiles.</p>

    <h2>🧠 The AI Watchdog – Not Just Sci-Fi Anymore</h2>

    <p>Everyone’s talking about it now—<strong>AI in cybersecurity</strong>. It's the new watchdog. And unlike the sleepy chowkidar, this one doesn’t nap. By the time your chai is brewed, AI’s already scanned logs, flagged weird activity, and quietly said, <em>“Something’s not right here.”</em></p>

    <p>It doesn’t blink. It doesn’t get bored. It learns—fast.</p>

    <p>But here’s the twist: so do the attackers.</p>

    <blockquote>
      The same tech guarding your digital home is also being used to figure out how to sneak in through the chimney.
    </blockquote>

    <p>There’s always someone building smarter locks, and someone else building smarter keys. It’s a never-ending chess match in the cloud.</p>

    <h2>🔐 So, What Can You Do?</h2>

    <p>Now, I know what you're thinking—“I’m no hacker.”<br>
    Exactly. Neither am I. But just like walking a dark alley with street smarts, there are a few habits that make all the difference online.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use strong passwords (like, actually strong—not <code>yourbirthday123</code>)</li>
      <li>Question unexpected emails, even if they come with “love” from your favourite cousin</li>
      <li>Keep your systems updated like you water your plants—regularly, and with care</li>
      <li>And don’t just trust tech—<em>understand it just enough</em> to not get played</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🌧️ Wisdom in the Rain</h2>

    <p>The hills have taught me this—every cedar tree stands taller when it’s weathered a few storms. And this digital world? It’s no different.</p>

    <p>So be sharp. Be kind. Be ready. Let AI help you, but don’t lose the human touch—the gut feeling, the habit of asking “does this look fishy?”</p>

    <p>Because the threats will come. They always do. But so will the tools. And the stories. And yes, even the lessons that come only after a storm has passed.</p>

    <blockquote>
      The world may rush ahead—but real wisdom? It shows up like mountain mist: quiet, slow, and always on time.
    </blockquote>
